# Classification-Clustering
Practising on WordClouds,Classification and Clustering on news dataset.

# Summary
Our dataset is derived from news and specifically has these categories=(business, entertainment, politics, sport, tech). So we tried to experiment with:
1) Creation of multiple WordClouds
2) Various classification's methods (SVM,Random Forest,Naive Bayes,K-Nearest Neighbour)
3) Extra pre-processing of data so as to beat the previous benchmark.
4) Clustering with representation of Bag-Of-Words and with pre-trained model Word2Vec with the help of Principal Component Analysis (which helped us with compression of dimensions).
